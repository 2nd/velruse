Velruse TODO
============

Next Release
------------

- Fix the Flask example to work with a Velruse standalone app.

- Document the standalone app.

Nice-to-Have
------------

- Create a Velruse WSGI middleware component. This would contain most of the
  current internals of the standalone app, but allow the credentials to be
  passed directly into an application (via the environ) without any
  sub-requests.

- OpenID doesn't seem to work with Google Hosted Apps.

- Improved testing.

  + Support request/response fixtures for each endpoint that can be
    run through to validate behavior.

  + Make selenium tests optional, and preferably have the server run
    in a thread within the test setup to avoid having to spin up a separate
    shell to run the server.

  + Create unit tests for the portable contacts conversion functions
    such as ``velruse.providers.facebook.extract_fb_data()``.

  + Automate testing, possibly via Travis-CI or Jenkins.
